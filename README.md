# About this repository

This is a separate repository for the Internet-Draft about the "P-Charge-Info" SIP header that first was submitted way back in February 2008. There's a long saga about why it is still floating around as a draft, but the intent of the authors is now to close on getting the draft published.

The history of drafts at the IETF can be found at: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-york-p-charge-info/

These files were originally part of a separate git repo at: https://github.com/danyork/internet-drafts-york
